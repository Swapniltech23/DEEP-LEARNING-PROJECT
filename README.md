# Sentiment Analysis Using DistilBERT

## 1.Introduction 
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone of a given text. It is widely applied in business, social media, finance, and healthcare to analyze opinions and feedback. In this task, we implemented sentiment analysis using DistilBERT, a lightweight version of BERT that maintains high accuracy while being faster and more efficient.  

Our goal was to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset into two categories: **positive (1)** or **negative (0)** using **Deep Learning**.  



## **2. Environment Used**  

### **2.1 Programming Language & Libraries**  

- **Python:** Used for its powerful libraries in machine learning and NLP.
  
- **Libraries Used:**
  
  - `transformers` (for pre-trained DistilBERT model)
     
  - `datasets` (for IMDb dataset)
    
  - `torch` (for deep learning computations)
      
  - `matplotlib & seaborn` (for visualizations)
     

### **2.2 Framework: Hugging Face Transformers**  

- Provides pre-trained **DistilBERT** models, making NLP tasks easier to implement.
  
- The `Trainer` API helps in training, evaluating, and making predictions.
  

### **2.3 Dataset: IMDb Movie Reviews**

- A **benchmark dataset** containing **50,000 movie reviews**, labeled as **positive** or **negative**.
   

### **2.4 Computing Environment**  

- **Google Colab (GPU-enabled):** Provides free hardware for deep learning.
   
- **Local Machines or Cloud Services (AWS, Azure, GCP):** Used for larger datasets.  



## **3. Steps in Sentiment Analysis**  

### **3.1 Data Preprocessing**

- Loaded the **IMDb dataset** using Hugging Face‚Äôs `datasets` library.
   
- Tokenized reviews using **DistilBERTTokenizer**, converting text into numerical inputs.
  

### **3.2 Model Training**  

- Loaded the **pre-trained DistilBERT model** for sequence classification.
  
- Fine-tuned the model on the IMDb dataset using:
  
  - **Cross-entropy loss** (for classification tasks)
     
  - **Adam optimizer** (to adjust learning rate)
     
- Used the `Trainer` API to handle training efficiently. 

### **3.3 Evaluation & Prediction**  

- Evaluated the trained model on the **test dataset**.
   
- Measured accuracy using `accuracy_score`.
   
- Plotted a **confusion matrix** to visualize correct and incorrect predictions.
  

### **3.4 Results and Insights** 

- The trained model achieved **high accuracy** in predicting sentiments.
   
- The **classification report** provided metrics like **precision, recall, and F1-score**.
   
- The **confusion matrix** showed some misclassified reviews, indicating areas for improvement.
  



## **4. Real-World Applications of Sentiment Analysis**  

### **4.1 Customer Feedback Analysis**  

- Businesses analyze customer reviews to improve their products/services.
  
- **Example:** Amazon identifies common complaints (e.g., ‚Äúpoor battery life‚Äù) and enhances product quality.  

### **4.2 Social Media Monitoring**  

- Used to track **brand reputation** and **public opinion**.
   
- **Example:** Companies analyze Twitter trends to adjust marketing strategies.  

### **4.3 Finance and Stock Market Predictions**

- Financial institutions analyze investor sentiment to predict **market trends**.
  
- **Example:** Negative sentiment about a CEO resignation may cause a stock price drop.  

### **4.4 Healthcare and Mental Health Analysis** 

- Sentiment analysis helps detect **stress, depression, or anxiety** in patient conversations.
   
- **Example:** AI mental health chatbots provide appropriate responses based on detected emotions.  

### **4.5 Political Sentiment Analysis** 

- Governments use sentiment analysis to gauge public opinions on policies and elections.
   
- **Example:** Political parties analyze voter sentiments to adjust campaign strategies.  



## **5. Conclusion**  

Sentiment analysis using **DistilBERT** is a powerful technique for analyzing public opinions and customer feedback. By fine-tuning **DistilBERT** on IMDb reviews, we built a model capable of predicting whether a review is **positive** or **negative**.  

This approach can be extended to various industries, such as **customer service automation, real-time social media tracking, and financial sentiment analysis**. Leveraging **pre-trained transformer models** like DistilBERT allows businesses to extract meaningful insights from large volumes of text efficiently. üöÄ
